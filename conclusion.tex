\chapter{Conclusion}


For unsupervised machine translation system, the context-aware beam search language model help at the lexicon choice step.\\
The denoising networks which aimed at the insertion/deletion/reordering noise in the word-by-word translation sentence works well for fertility and localized reordering problem. 
Even though BPE is known to be an effective way to overcome the rare word problem in standard NMT, BPE embedding performs worse than word embedding in our case especially when vocabulary is small.\\
Word-by-word translation based on cross-lingual word embedding depends highly on the frequent word mappings. We found that phrase embedding only helps in word-by-word translation with context-aware beam search, it works not as good as that under the processing of denoising autoencoder.
