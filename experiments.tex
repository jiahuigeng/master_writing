\chapter{Experiments}
In this chapter, we present experimental results of our proposed methods: corpus-based unsupervised learning algorithm for cross-lingual word embedding and unsupervised MT system integrating LM and DAE. We also empirically analyze the effect of different factors in these methods: corpus size, embedding unit, vocabulary size and artificial noises. Before that, we describe the parameter settings, evaluation methodology, and datasets for our experiments.



\section{Corpus Statistics}
 The training corpora for embedding and LM training are the same, containing 100M sentences
 sampled from News Crawl 2014-2017 monolingual
 corpora. The data was lowercased and filtered
 to have a maximum sentence length 100. The test datasets are for MT evaluation, from WMT 2016   German$\leftrightarrow$English task and WMT 2014 French$\leftrightarrow$English task. We restrict MT vocabulary size to 50k. OOV rates reflect that the vocabulary size we set is reasonable. Each LM perplexity is in the proper range. Detailed statistics are in Table 6.1, 6.2.

\section{Experimental Setup}
We train monoligual word embeddings with a dimensionality of 300 using FastText (\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/BojanowskiGJM16}) for 5 epochs, only for words that have occurs at least 10 times. Our corpus-based approach is also implemented on MUSE framework (\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1710-04087}). Vocabulary sizes for source and target side are limited to 50k.
$5$-gram LMs are trained separately using KenLM with Kneserâ€“Ney smoothing (\cite{heafield2011kenlm}).\\
LM supported context-aware beam search is performed among top 100 word translation candidates for each position with beam size 10.\\
DAE is implemented in Sockeye (\cite{hieber2017sockeye}), using RNN and Transformer architectures. RNN-based DAE has 2-layer encoder and 2-layer decoder, the hidden layer size is 512. In Transfomer based DAE, encoder and decoder both have 6 layers and hidden layer size is also 512. The multi-head attention mechanism uses 6 heads. DAEs are trained on smaller monolingual corpora containing 20M sentences. \\
We evaluate different cross-lingual embedding learning methods on cross-lingual word retrieval tasks. The datasets are released by \cite{}, which contains dictionaries for 12 language pairs. Each test dictionary contains 1500 unique source words for evaluation.  
\section{Word Translation}
We conduct the cross-lingual word retrieval task on English$\leftrightarrow$German pair. Empirically, we find the best sentence batch size is 1k and the best initial lr is $0.0001$. Numbers in Table 6.3 are the accuracy results, with the same sentence batch size and initial lr. The last three rows are the baseline experiments: adversarial training, adversarial training with refinement, and supervised learning. Dictionary with 5000 unique source words are provided for supervised learning. We run the novel corpus-based approach on a relative small corpus with 50k sentences, sampled from the training corpus. We implement  different lr schedulers. The first one is to start from initial lr, the second one is to inherit the lr after the training on previous batch sentences. We demonstrate the results for German$\rightarrow$ English and English $\rightarrow$ German with the first scheduler, also the performance of  German$\rightarrow$ English with second scheduler.

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Cross-lingual word retrieval accuracy}
\end{table}
%In general, $1k$ is a option for sentence batch size. The embedding mappings from English to German and from German to English show close results.
%However the second Empirically, we find the best sentence batch size is 1k and initial lrscheduler inheriting last lr works not as well as the first one. We augment training data by training 2 epochs and extending the corpus to 200k sentences. The results are in Table 6.7, the sentence batch size is $1k$ and initial lr are set to $0.0001$, the best settings empirically.\\
%	\end{itemize}
As demonstrated in Table 6.3, the retrieval accuracy of supervised learning is the highest among the results, with iterative refinements the performance of adversarial training proposed by \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1710-04087} is very close to supervised case. \\
Our corpus-based approach works well, though there is 4\% distance to supervised training. It surpasses the approach using adversarial training only. The first lr scheduler always performs better than the second one, and results for mappings from English to German and from German to English are near, this is what we have expected.  Without LM the corpus-based approach can still learn a mapping, but finally results much worse than that integrating LM.\\

\end{figure}
We plot how retrieval accuracy varies w.r.t the number of training batches in Figure 6.1. The overlapping curves are from corpus-based approach with the first lr sheduler.  Without LM, the green curve increases slowly and converges finally under the normal approach. The curve for the second scheduler increases most slowly at the beginning, and rise obviously after a half of training batches. Since it still keeps increasing, we augment the training data by training for two epochs and extend the corpus size to 200k. The results are shown in Table 6.4.\\

The performance of the second scheduler gets improved when enlarging training data, but is still not so good as the first scheduler.

	\caption{Translation results on German$\leftrightarrow$English \texttt{newstest2016} and French$\leftrightarrow$English \texttt{newstest2014}}

\end{table}
As demonstrated in Table 6.5, LM improves wordby-word
baselines consistently in all four tasks, giving at least +3\% BLEU. When our denoising
model is applied on top of it, we have additional
gain around +3\% BLEU. Note that our methods
do not involve any decoding steps to generate
pseudo-parallel training data, but still perform
better than unsupervised MT systems that rely on
repetitive back-translations by up to +3.9\% BLEU.
%above, our unsupervised MT surpass the start-of-the-art unsupervised NMT in almost all cases except English$\rightarrow$French translation. Each sub-model lift the performance respectively. Copy OOV word from source sentences works better than those predicted by language model, because OOV words are usually specific name entities and LM prefers common words rather than rare words. Denoising autoencoder based on Transformer structure outputs better translation than the traditional RNN structure.

As in Table 6.9, larger corpus improves the word translation accuracy as well as the word-by-word translation. 

\subsection{BPE vs Word}
Byte pair encoding (BPE)(\cite{sennrich2015neural}) is a simple data compression technique for word segmentation. It allows for the representation of an open vocabulary through a fixed-size vocabulary of variable-character sequences, making it very suitable word segmentation strategy for neural network models. It helps to reduce the vocabulary size and they eliminate the presence of unknown words in the output translation. We use BPE to represent the mapping between languages and compare with word-level cross-lingual embeddings. In BPE algorithm, the vocabulary is updated using an iterative greedy algorithm. Merges in Table 6.7 denotes the pre-defined number of merge operations. 
	\begin{table}[h]

	\centering
	\scalebox{1}{
		\begin{tabular}{lcc}
			\toprule
			\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Vocabulary}} & \textsc{Bleu} [\%] \\

			& 200k & 14.4\\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	
	}\\
	\caption{Translation results with different vocabularies.}
\end{table}


%As in Table 6.10, the BPE performs worse than word in this unsupervised learning scenario. It might be difficult to learn the translation relationship between subword units. Also for sentence translation, larger vocabulary size does not improve the performance. In order to balance the efficiency and accuracy we limit the vocabulary size to 50k. To improve the results, LM are exploited here.
We examine how the translation performance varies with different vocabularies of cross-lingual word embedding in Table 6.7. The first three show that BPE embeddings performs worse than word embeddings, especially with smaller vocabulary size. For small BPE tokens (1-3 characters),
the context they meet during the embedding
training is much more various than a complete word, and a direct translation of such small
token to a BPE token of another language would be very ambiguous. For word level embeddings, we compared different vocabulary sizes used for training the
cross-lingual mapping. Surprisingly, cross-lingual word embedding learned only on top 20k words is comparable to that of 200k words in the translation quality. This means that word-by-word translation with crosslingual embedding depends highly on the frequent word mappings, and learning the mapping between rare words does not have a positive effect. 

\subsection{Artificial Noise}

			\scalebox{1}{
	\begin{tabular}{cccrc}
		\toprule
		$d_\text{per}$ & $p_\text{del}$ & $p_\text{ins}$ & $V_\text{ins}$ & \textsc{Bleu} [\%] \\

		2 & & & & 14.7\\
		3 & & & & \leavevmode\color{blue}{14.9}\\
		5 & & & & 14.9\\
		\midrule
		\multirow{2}{*}{3} & 0.1 & &  & \leavevmode\color{blue}{15.7} \\

		& & & 500 & 16.8 \\
		& & & 5000 & 16.5\\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
}

	\label{tab:denoising}
		\caption{ Translation results with different values of denoising
			parameters.}
\end{table}
To examine the effect of each noise type in denoising
autoencoder, we tuned each parameter of the noise and combined them incrementally as in Table 6.8.  Firstly, for permutations, a significant improvement is achieved from $d_{per}$ = 3, since a local
reordering usually involves a sequence of 3 to 4
words. With $d_{per} \le 5$ , it shuffles too many consecutive
words together, yielding no further improvement.
This noise cannot handle long-range reordering, which is usually a swap of words that are far from each other, keeping the words in the
middle as they are. \\
Secondly, we applied the deletion noise with
different values of $p_{del}$. 0.1 gives +0.8\% BLEU, but we immediately see a degradation with a larger value; it is hard to observe more than one one-tomany
translations in each Germanâ†’English sentence pair.
Finally, we tested several sizes of $V_{ins}$ for the
insertion noise, fixing $p_{ins}$ = 0.1. Increasing $V_{ins}$
is generally not beneficial, since it provides too
much variations in the inserted word, which might
not be related to its neighboring words. Overall,
we observe the best result (+1.5\% BLEU) with
$V_{ins} = 50$.

\end{table}
%With word2vec tool (\cite{mikolov2013distributed}) we detect phrases in the training corpus. We set threshold value to 100, 500, 2000 to make the number of phrases differs. Fewer phrases will be detected as we lift the threshold value. As to our method, we extract only bigrams that in the top 50k frequent bigrams in the training corpus. We learn phrase embedding in an unsupervised manner as normal word embedding. \\
%As demonstrates in Table
We examine how phrase embedding performs in MT. Phrase embedding using detection technique proposed by \cite{mikolov2013distributed} works better if we lift up the threshold value. The performance of MT gets harmed when too many phrases. And the results is even worse than word embedding.  While with our phrase detection method, BLEU of MT results is higher when using word-by-word translation and integrating LM. The final results are denoising step is not as good as word embedding. 
%?????? not sure if I need to add this corresponding part in unsupervised cross-lingual embedding
